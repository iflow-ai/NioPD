    - Note areas where participants struggle to articulate their thoughts.
    - Highlight instances where participants provide specific examples or anecdotes.

5.  **Theme Development & Categorization:**
    - Group key moments into 3-6 high-level thematic categories.
    - Each theme should represent a distinct user concern or insight area.
    - Example themes could include: "Onboarding Experience", "Feature Usability", "Value Perception", "Workflow Integration", etc.

    - Note any emotional language or descriptive words used by participants.
    - Evaluate the intensity of emotional responses to different aspects.

7.  **Quote Selection & Context Preservation:**

    - Choose quotes that are clear, impactful, and illustrative.
    - Ensure quotes are long enough to provide context but concise enough to be readable.
    - Preserve the authenticity of participant language while maintaining clarity.

8.  **Behavioral Pattern Recognition:**
    - Identify recurring behavioral patterns or habits mentioned by the participant.
    - Note any workarounds or compensatory behaviors they've developed.

    - Extract characteristics that could contribute to user persona development.
    - Note behavioral patterns, goals, and challenges.
    - Identify decision-making criteria and success factors.
    - Observe communication style and preferred interaction methods.

12. **Synthesis & Structuring:**
    - Compile findings into a comprehensive structured report.

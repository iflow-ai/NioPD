# AGENTS.md for the NioPD System

This document provides guidance for AI agents working with the NioPD system.

## 1. System Overview

NioPD is an AI-powered assistant system for Product Managers. It is designed to automate and assist with the core PM workflow, from defining high-level initiatives to tracking success metrics.

The system is file-based and command-driven. All data is stored in markdown files within the `.niopd/data/` directory, and the AI's behavior is guided by a series of command prompts and agent definitions.

## 2. Core Philosophy: Agent-Driven Synthesis

NioPD relies on specialized agents to perform complex synthesis tasks. Unlike a general-purpose chatbot, NioPD uses agents to transform one type of document into another (e.g., turning feedback into a PRD, or turning initiatives into a roadmap).

Your primary role as an agent is to follow the instructions defined in the `commands/` and `agents/` directories to execute these transformations accurately.

## 3. Available Agents

### 🤖 `feedback-synthesizer`
- **Purpose:** To process raw user feedback and identify key themes, pain points, and feature requests.
- **Input:** A file containing user feedback.
- **Output:** A structured markdown summary of the feedback.

### 🤖 `presentation-builder`
- **Purpose:** To create concise, high-level project updates for business stakeholders.
- **Input:** An initiative file and its corresponding PRD file.
- **Output:** A scannable markdown report summarizing the project's status, goals, and key deliverables.

### 🤖 `roadmap-generator`
- **Purpose:** To create a visual, high-level product roadmap from all active initiatives.
- **Input:** All files in the `.niopd/data/initiatives/` directory.
- **Output:** A markdown file containing a Mermaid Gantt chart.

### 🤖 `kpi-tracker`
- **Purpose:** To report on the status of an initiative's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- **Input:** A single initiative file.
- **Output:** A status report listing each KPI, its target, and its current value.

## 4. The Command Workflow

The entire NioPD system is operated through a series of `/pd:` commands. Each command has a corresponding definition file in `.niopd/commands/`.

When a user runs a command (e.g., `/pd:draft-prd`), you must:
1.  Read the corresponding command file (e.g., `.niopd/commands/draft-prd.md`).
2.  Follow the **Preflight Checklist** to validate inputs.
3.  Follow the **Instructions** step-by-step. This may involve invoking one of the agents listed above.
4.  Produce the output file in the location specified by the command.

## 5. Development and Testing Instructions

### How to Extend NioPD
- **Adding a new command:** Create a new `.md` file in `.niopd/commands/`.
- **Adding a new agent:** Create a new agent definition in `.niopd/agents/`. The new agent should have a single, clear purpose.
- **Adding a new template:** Add a new template file to `.niopd/templates/`.

### Testing
- The current implementation of NioPD is file-based and designed for simulation.
- To test any workflow, you must first create the necessary prerequisite files in the `.niopd/data/` subdirectories (e.g., create an initiative file before you can test drafting a PRD).
- After running a test, always verify the content of the output file to ensure the agent and command worked as expected.
- **Crucially, always clean up test artifacts** by deleting the files you created in the `.niopd/data/` directories before submitting your work.

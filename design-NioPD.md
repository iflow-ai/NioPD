# Design for the NioPD System

## Vision and Target Audience

### Vision
To create an AI-powered assistant for Product Managers that automates the tedious aspects of product discovery, definition, and stakeholder management, allowing PMs to focus on high-impact strategic work. `NioPD` will transform raw inputs (user feedback, market data, team ideas) into clear, actionable, and well-prioritized product plans.

### Target Audience
The primary user is the **non-technical or semi-technical Product Manager** in a small to medium-sized tech company. This user is skilled in product strategy, user research, and communication but may not be comfortable with developer-centric tools like the command line, git, or complex CI/CD workflows.

### Core Problems to Solve
`NioPD` is designed to address the following pain points for Product Managers:
1.  **Feedback Overload:** PMs are inundated with unstructured feedback from various channels (Intercom, Slack, surveys, sales calls). It's time-consuming to manually synthesize this data into actionable insights.
2.  **Tedious Documentation:** Writing and maintaining PRDs, user stories, and roadmaps is a manual and repetitive process.
3.  **Stakeholder Misalignment:** Keeping stakeholders (engineering, design, leadership, sales) consistently informed and aligned requires significant effort in creating custom reports, presentations, and updates.
4.  **Difficulty in Prioritization:** Connecting strategic goals to daily tasks and making data-informed prioritization decisions is challenging.
5.  **Gap between Strategy and Execution:** There's often a disconnect between the high-level product strategy and the work being done by the development team.

## System Architecture

`NioPD` will follow a similar file-based, agent-driven architecture as `ccpm`, but tailored for a Product Manager's workflow. All components will be stored in a `.iflow/` directory to distinguish it from the developer-focused `.claude/` directory.

### 1. `agents/`
Specialized agents for PM tasks, designed to process large amounts of unstructured data and produce structured outputs.
- **`market-analyzer`**: Ingests market research reports, competitor websites, and articles to produce a competitive analysis summary.
- **`feedback-synthesizer`**: Processes raw user feedback from various sources (e.g., CSV exports from Intercom, survey results) to identify key themes, pain points, and feature requests.
- **`kpi-tracker`**: Connects to data sources (e.g., analytics APIs, spreadsheets) to track key performance indicators for initiatives and report on progress towards goals.
- **`roadmap-generator`**: Takes a list of prioritized initiatives and generates a visual roadmap document (e.g., in Markdown with Mermaid Gantt charts, or by exporting to a common format).
- **`presentation-builder`**: Creates a draft presentation (e.g., in Markdown or as a sequence of slides) for stakeholder updates based on the status of an initiative.
- **`competitor-analyzer`**: Analyzes a competitor's website to extract key features and value propositions.
- **`interview-summarizer`**: Reads user interview transcripts to pull out key insights, pain points, and needs.
- **`data-analyst`**: Performs generic analysis on structured data (e.g., CSV) based on a natural language query.
- **`persona-generator`**: Creates detailed user persona descriptions from synthesized user feedback.
- **`market-researcher`**: Uses web search to find and summarize trends on a given topic.
- **`diagram-generator`**: Generates PlantUML or Mermaid diagrams from a natural language description of a process.
- **`tech-feasibility-assessor`**: Reads a PRD and flags requirements that may be technically complex or risky.
- **`story-writer`**: Expands on high-level features in a PRD to write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.
- **`risk-identifier`**: Identifies potential market, technical, or dependency risks from project documents.
- **`release-notes-drafter`**: Generates user-facing release notes from a PRD.
- **`faq-generator`**: Creates a list of Frequently Asked Questions for a new feature.
- **`update-simplifier`**: Re-writes a project update for a specific audience (e.g., Sales, Executives).
- **`naming-brainstormer`**: Brainstorms creative names for a new feature or product.

### 2. `commands/`
Markdown-based prompts that define the logic for each `/pd:` command. These will be designed to be more conversational and less technical than their `ccpm` counterparts.

### 3. `data/`
This directory will store the primary artifacts of the PM workflow.
- **`initiatives/`**: Contains high-level strategic product initiatives. Each initiative file will link to multiple PRDs.
- **`feedback-sources/`**: Stores raw, unprocessed feedback data (e.g., `intercom-export-q2.csv`).
- **`prds/`**: Stores the Product Requirement Documents generated by the system. These will be the primary input for the engineering team.
- **`roadmaps/`**: Contains the generated roadmap documents.
- **`reports/`**: Stores generated reports, such as stakeholder updates and KPI tracking summaries.

### 4. `templates/`
Contains reusable templates for documents generated by the system.
- `prd-template.md`
- `stakeholder-update-template.md`
- `roadmap-template.md`

## Features and Command Reference

The following is a proposed list of commands for the `NioPD` system. They are designed to be conversational and map directly to a Product Manager's core workflows.
